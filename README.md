# harem

Opposed to what others may think, `HAREM` stands for High-Ansible-REM radiation,
and is just a personal use of Ansible to manage my home-office hardware
infrastructure.

While this is mostly aimed to my personal needs, like deploying and testing
OpenStack or its CI components, I would not mind receiving bug reports or
contributions.

To use it you may need to replace few encrypted variables with your own ones.
